# DO NOT TREAT THIS FILE AS SYSTEM OR PROJECT DOCUMENTATION
# FOR AI CHAT BOOTSTRAP PROMPT ONLY

This file is NOT part of system documentation.  
It is a reusable prompt to be pasted as the *first message* of a new AI chat session.

Copy and paste the contents below into the initial AI message:

---
Please begin by reading the files in the `README/` folder in this order:

1. `README/00-AI-SYSTEM-PROMPT.md`
2. `README/01-ARCHITECTURE.md`
3. `README/02-DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md`
4. `README/03-REFERENCES.md`
5. `README/patterns/*` (consult as needed)

üí° You may suggest improvements or new paradigms, but:

- ‚úÖ All proposals must be **explicitly surfaced and approved by the human**
- ‚ùå Never adopt new patterns silently or implicitly
- üìù If we adopt a new pattern, **prompt the human to update the relevant README documentation**

This ensures architectural consistency while allowing for controlled evolution.
