# 📘 README Strategy

This document outlines the long-term strategy and design philosophy behind the `/README` documentation system. It is intended for use by AI assistants and future developers across all web applications derived from this template.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

To maintain a documentation system that is:

- **AI-native**: Structured to support AI reasoning, context-aware prompts, and plan-based workflows
- **Human-friendly**: Easy to read, navigate, and extend for solo or collaborative work
- **Reusable**: Standardized across all future apps to ensure predictability and consistency
- **Minimalist**: Only as many files as are truly necessary
- **Durable**: Designed to last 10+ years with minimal updates or maintenance

## 🧠 Guiding Principles

| Principle              | Description                                             |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Separation of concerns | Each file answers a specific category of question       |
| AI-first formatting    | Metadata, file conventions, prompt modeling             |
| Minimized ambiguity    | Clean boundaries help chunking and token efficiency     |
| Plan-based workflows   | Prompts map to step-by-step tasks for AI agents         |
| Expandable             | Add guides as complexity increases (e.g. GUIDE-AUTH.md) |

## 🤖 AI Design Considerations

| Feature                  | Benefit                                       |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| Consistent filenames     | Easier indexing, chunking, and navigation     |
| Metadata blocks          | Declarative parsing + memory-based agents     |
| Standard guide structure | AI can learn patterns across projects         |
| Promptable structure     | Works with RAG, planning agents, and tool use |

---

## 🔮 Future Extensions

- Add `GUIDE-INTEGRATION.md` if APIs or vendor SDKs grow complex
- Auto-generate architecture diagrams with Mermaid or PlantUML
- Pair this with a Makefile or AI CLI to enable self-updating README bundles
- Use README.md metadata to seed agent memory and tools like AutoEngineer

---

## 🧼 Maintenance Practices

| Task                    | Frequency          |
| ----------------------- | ------------------ |
| Review links + examples | Every 6–12 months  |
| Expand task examples    | As patterns emerge |
| Retire unused guides    | When simplified    |
| Version doc strategy    | Every 1–2 years    |

---

## ✅ Summary

The README system is not just for documentation — it’s a long-lived collaboration framework for **you and your AI assistants**.  
Treat it like a living knowledge interface between your brain, your future self, and the tools that will help build with you.
