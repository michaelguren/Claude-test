This file is a merged representation of the entire codebase, combined into a single document by Repomix.
The content has been processed where line numbers have been added, content has been compressed (code blocks are separated by ⋮---- delimiter), security check has been disabled.

File Summary
================================================================

Purpose:
--------
This file contains a packed representation of the entire repository's contents.
It is designed to be easily consumable by AI systems for analysis, code review,
or other automated processes.

File Format:
------------
The content is organized as follows:
1. This summary section
2. Repository information
3. Directory structure
4. Repository files (if enabled)
5. Multiple file entries, each consisting of:
  a. A separator line (================)
  b. The file path (File: path/to/file)
  c. Another separator line
  d. The full contents of the file
  e. A blank line

Usage Guidelines:
-----------------
- This file should be treated as read-only. Any changes should be made to the
  original repository files, not this packed version.
- When processing this file, use the file path to distinguish
  between different files in the repository.
- Be aware that this file may contain sensitive information. Handle it with
  the same level of security as you would the original repository.

Notes:
------
- Some files may have been excluded based on .gitignore rules and Repomix's configuration
- Binary files are not included in this packed representation. Please refer to the Repository Structure section for a complete list of file paths, including binary files
- Files matching patterns in .gitignore are excluded
- Files matching default ignore patterns are excluded
- Line numbers have been added to the beginning of each line
- Content has been compressed - code blocks are separated by ⋮---- delimiter
- Security check has been disabled - content may contain sensitive information
- Files are sorted by Git change count (files with more changes are at the bottom)

# AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store & AWS Secrets Manager

There are two templates in this project.

1. Under the create-secrets folder, this template creates SSM and Secrets Manager parameters.
2. Under the app folder, this template creates a serverless application that utilizes the secrets in different ways.
