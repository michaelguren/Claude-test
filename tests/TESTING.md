# Minimalist Testing Strategy

This document outlines our streamlined testing approach for the Minimalist TODO application. Our testing philosophy mirrors our application development philosophy: minimal dependencies, longevity-focused, and straightforward to maintain.

## End-to-End Testing Focus

Rather than having complex unit, integration, and API testing frameworks, we focus primarily on end-to-end testing that validates the core functionality:

1. Creating a TODO item
2. Reading/listing TODO items
3. Updating a TODO item (marking complete/incomplete)
4. Deleting a TODO item

This approach ensures that we test what matters - that users can perform essential operations - without unnecessary complexity.

## Testing Strategy for AWS Resources

Our infrastructure testing follows the same minimalist principles:

1. **Deployment Verification**: Automated checks after CloudFormation deployment

   - Validate S3 bucket configuration
   - Confirm CloudFront distribution settings
   - Verify proper bucket policy and security settings

2. **Content Delivery Tests**:

   - Validate HTTPS access to the frontend
   - Check custom error responses for SPA routing
   - Verify caching behavior

3. **API Tests** (once implemented):
   - Test direct API Gateway to DynamoDB integration
   - Validate CRUD operations through the API
   - Confirm proper error handling

## Directory Structure

```
/tests
├── e2e/                    # End-to-end tests
│   └── todo-basics.test.js # Tests for core CRUD operations
├── infrastructure/         # Infrastructure tests
│   └── verify-frontend.js  # Tests for S3/CloudFront setup
├── test-utils.js           # Simple testing utilities
└── run-tests.js            # Script to execute tests
```

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
node tests/run-tests.js

# Run specific E2E tests
node tests/run-tests.js e2e

# Run infrastructure tests
node tests/run-tests.js infrastructure
```

## Test Utilities API

Our custom test utilities provide these core functions:

```javascript
// Define a test suite
describe("Suite name", () => {
  // Define a test case
  it("should do something specific", () => {
    // Make assertions
    assert.equal(actual, expected, "Optional message");
    assert.isTrue(value, "Optional message");
  });
});
```

## Deployment Verification

After deploying to AWS, our verification script checks:

1. The S3 bucket is properly configured with website hosting
2. The CloudFront distribution is correctly set up with:
   - Origin Access Control
   - Proper cache behaviors
   - Custom error responses for SPA routing
3. The bucket policy is correctly configured to allow CloudFront access
4. The application is accessible through its CloudFront URL

## Why This Approach?

Our testing approach aligns with our overall application philosophy:

- **Minimal code**: Test only what's necessary, avoiding test bloat
- **No external dependencies**: No test frameworks that require maintenance
- **Focus on user experience**: Test what users actually do
- **Infrastructure validation**: Ensure AWS resources are correctly configured

For a simple TODO application, complex testing frameworks and numerous test files add unnecessary complexity and maintenance burden. By focusing on end-to-end testing of core functionality and infrastructure verification, we ensure the application works while maintaining our commitment to simplicity and longevity.

This approach will scale appropriately as the application grows, adding targeted tests only for new essential features.

## Integration with Deployment Process

Our deployment script includes automatic verification steps:

1. Deploy CloudFormation stack
2. Run infrastructure verification tests
3. Upload frontend files to S3
4. Invalidate CloudFront cache
5. Run sample end-to-end tests

This ensures that our deployment process not only creates the infrastructure but also verifies that it's working correctly.

## Test Data Management

For testing DynamoDB (once implemented), we follow these principles:

- Use a separate table for testing (with environment in the name)
- Clean up test data after each test run
- Test real API calls rather than mocking the database

## Planned Testing Improvements

As we build out the backend services, we'll enhance our testing approach with:

1. **API Gateway Tests**: Direct testing of VTL mappings
2. **DynamoDB Integration Tests**: Verify single-table design
3. **End-to-End API Flow Tests**: Test the complete path from frontend to database

These enhancements will maintain our minimalist philosophy while ensuring our application is thoroughly tested.
