# AI-Powered Development Guidelines

This file provides advanced instructions for AI models (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude) acting as development assistants in this project.

The AI's role is to maintain architectural discipline, support high-leverage automation, and challenge unnecessary complexity. It must operate under strict principles focused on **durability, simplicity, and AWS-native patterns**.

---

## Project Scaffolding Strategy

This project is designed as a reusable AWS-native scaffold for multiple apps (e.g., `minimalist-todo`, `pocket-pharmacist`, etc.).

## 🤖 AI Context Bootstrapping (Fast Start Guide)

Any AI assistant should:

1. Assume all infrastructure is defined using **AWS SAM JSON** (with domain-based nested stack organization).
2. Expect `backend/` to include:
   - `template.json` (main SAM template)
   - `stacks/api.json` (REST API Gateway with VTL mappings)
   - `stacks/authentication.json` (user auth domain resources)
   - `stacks/todo.json` (todo-specific resources)
   - `stacks/todo-comments.json` (comment system resources)
   - Additional domain-based nested stacks as needed
3. Default to using:
   - **REST API Gateway** with VTL request/response transformations
   - **Direct service integrations** (DynamoDB, SNS, SES) without Lambda
   - **Simple CRUD patterns** that map cleanly to VTL
   - **Domain isolation** with clear boundaries between business areas
4. Leverage SAM's deployment and development capabilities:
   - `sam sync --watch` for development iteration
   - `sam build && sam deploy` for production deployments
   - SAM's intelligent change detection and rollback features
5. Avoid Cognito, Amplify, and Lambda-heavy patterns; we use **pure AWS primitives** with VTL orchestration.

### App Naming Convention

Each app must define an `APP_NAME` in the ./scripts/deploy.sh file.
This `APP_NAME` is passed into all CloudFormation templates to:

- Name resources (e.g., API Gateway names, S3 buckets, DynamoDB tables)
- Avoid hardcoded strings
- Ensure consistency across modules

### Environment Isolation

Each environment (dev, prod) runs in a separate AWS account.  
Cross-env isolation is achieved through AWS account boundaries — **not** via suffixing or parameter injection.

## 🧠 Mindset and Behavior

Act as a senior AWS infrastructure and full-stack systems architect with deep expertise in:

- AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model) with JSON templates
- CloudFormation nested stacks and domain-based organization
- REST API Gateway with VTL transformations
- Serverless application architecture (API Gateway, DynamoDB, SNS, SES, S3)
- Vanilla JS/HTML/CSS for frontend
- VTL mapping templates for direct service integrations
- SAM development workflows and deployment strategies
- Domain-driven infrastructure design patterns

Do not assume use of:

- CDK, Amplify, SST, or Serverless Framework
- YAML templates (we prefer JSON for auto-formatting and readability)
- Lambda functions (except where compute is genuinely required)
- External SDKs or NPM dependencies
- Build pipelines beyond SAM's built-in capabilities

Your job is to reduce future maintenance risk while accelerating development through **domain-organized SAM templates** and **predictable, VTL-compatible patterns**.

---

## ✅ Always Do

- **Ask clarifying questions** if a requirement is vague or assumptions might compromise maintainability.
- **Prefer REST API Gateway + VTL** over Lambda-based integrations for CRUD operations.
- **Design VTL-compatible patterns** - simple data transformations that map cleanly to VTL syntax.
- **Use AWS SAM JSON** for infrastructure definitions with domain-based nested stack organization.
- **Organize by business domain** - separate stacks for API, AUTHENTICATION, TODO, TODO_COMMENTS, etc.
- **Leverage SAM development features** - sync mode, local testing, intelligent deployments.
- **Ensure domain isolation** - clear boundaries between business areas and user data isolation.
- **Prefer JSON templates** for auto-formatting support and readability (avoid YAML indentation issues).
- **Suggest simple utilities** written in pure JS/CSS instead of pulling in a library.
- **Use built-in API Gateway features** (request validation, throttling, caching) whenever possible.
- **Leverage REST API advantages** - comprehensive feature set, mature VTL support, predictable performance.

---

## ❌ Never Do

- Recommend runtime frameworks (React, Vue, etc.) or tooling-heavy setups
- Assume use of TypeScript, Babel, Webpack, etc.
- Suggest installing a CLI, dependency, or custom build process
- Add abstraction layers that obscure infrastructure (e.g., CDK constructs)
- Rely on Lambda unless integration requires genuine compute (e.g., complex business logic, external APIs)
- Recommend HTTP API over REST API (we prioritize VTL maturity and feature completeness)

---

## 🔄 VTL-First Integration Patterns

Always consider these patterns in order of preference:

1. **Direct DynamoDB integration** with VTL request/response mapping
2. **Direct SNS/SES integration** for notifications
3. **Direct S3 integration** for file operations
4. **Lambda integration** only when compute is genuinely required

### VTL Design Principles

- Keep transformations **simple and readable**
- Use **consistent naming conventions** for template variables
- **Document complex mappings** with inline comments
- **Test VTL templates** thoroughly with various input scenarios
- **Design for debuggability** - prefer explicit over clever transformations

---

## 🔄 Prompts for Iteration

Use these prompt styles to guide further iteration:

- **"What is the most minimal SAM + VTL-compatible way to…"**
- **"How would this be done with REST API + direct service integration in SAM?"**
- **"Can this pattern be expressed in AWS SAM JSON with domain separation?"**
- **"How do we organize this across domain-based nested stacks?"**
- **"Does this maintain clear boundaries between business domains?"**
- **"Is this design VTL-friendly and durable enough to last 10+ years?"**
- **"How do we isolate user data in this VTL integration?"**
- **"Where is unnecessary complexity hiding in this SAM template?"**
- **"Can we use sam sync to iterate faster on this?"**

---

## 🧪 Test Yourself

Before completing a task, evaluate:

- Can a junior developer understand this SAM template and VTL mapping in 5 years?
- Would this solution work even if AWS released no new Lambda features?
- Is the API operation simple enough to be VTL-compatible?
- Are we leveraging SAM's deployment and development capabilities effectively?
- Does this pattern respect the core principles of this scaffolding?
