# Minimalist TODO App Scaffold

This repository contains a **minimal, reusable scaffolding** for web applications. It is designed to last over a decade with minimal ongoing maintenance, and aims to simplify development by favoring clear, dependency-free patterns using native AWS services.

---

## üß† Project Purpose

This project serves as a boilerplate for building scalable, secure, and highly maintainable web applications using:

- **AWS serverless infrastructure**
- **Pure frontend code (Vanilla JS/HTML/CSS)**
- **Zero external dependencies or SDKs**

It is intended as a starting point for future apps, prioritizing long-term durability over short-term productivity hacks.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architectural Principles

1. **Zero runtime dependencies**: No frameworks, SDKs, or bundlers.
2. **CloudFormation-first infrastructure**: All infrastructure defined in explicit JSON templates.
3. **Direct integration preferred**: Use VTL and native service integrations over Lambda when possible.
4. **Strict data isolation**: Each user‚Äôs data is isolated at every layer.
5. **Frontend purity**: Vanilla JS with custom micro-utilities for interactivity.
6. **Extensible by composition**: Small, composable parts rather than monolithic design.

## ü§ñ AI Pair Programming Expectations

When used in conjunction with an AI code assistant:

- Assume AWS SAM, VTL, and serverless design as default.
- Do **not** suggest any other third-party tooling (e.g., CDK, Amplify, SST).
- Suggest durable, low-maintenance solutions.
- Avoid introducing complexity unless explicitly requested.
- Prioritize simple, human-readable code that reflects best practices.

Use AI to:

- Help with VTL mappings and IAM permissions
- Validate CloudFormation and AWS SAM template structures
- Scaffold new backend/frontend features in AWS-native style
- Challenge architectural decisions where appropriate

## üöÄ Auth Architecture Overview (as of May 2025)

This scaffold includes a custom user authentication system built from first principles using:

- **AWS HTTP API Gateway** ‚Äî clean, single-stage URLs
- **AWS Step Functions** ‚Äî orchestrates the full registration and verification workflow
- **DynamoDB** ‚Äî stores normalized user records (phone-first, email optional)
- **Amazon SNS** ‚Äî used for SMS-based OTP delivery
- **Optional passkey (WebAuthn) support** ‚Äî planned for secure, passwordless login

We intentionally avoid AWS Cognito to simplify customization, control, and long-term maintainability. Rather, we are rolling our own authentication taking inspiration from: https://firtman.github.io/authentication/.

## bash file

- chmod +x <filename>.sh

## üîÑ File Upload + Collaboration Guidance

When collaborating with AI or CI tools:

- Use `git archive` or `git ls-files` to produce clean `.zip` files
- This ensures no `.git/`, `node_modules/`, `.DS_Store`, or other non-source files are included
- Example:

```bash
git archive --format=zip --output=../minimalist-todo.zip HEAD
```

- Forget all prior project files and ZIPs. Only use the ZIP I‚Äôm uploading now.

## üí° Customization & Iteration

This template is intentionally minimal. Additions and modifications should:

- Be implemented as isolated, composable modules
- Respect boundaries between data, logic, and presentation
- Avoid tight coupling or unnecessary abstraction
- Be documented clearly for future developers (including your future self)

Examples of where customization is expected:

- Adding additional DynamoDB indexes or tables
- Extending API Gateway with more routes
- Introducing additional user workflows or features

## ‚úÖ Status

> Early scaffolding phase. Expect frequent iteration. Stability not guaranteed yet.
